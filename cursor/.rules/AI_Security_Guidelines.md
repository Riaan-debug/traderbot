# Security Guidelines for AI-powered Applications

## 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Always validate and sanitize user-provided data (e.g., prompts, forms, files).
- Prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, command-injection, prompt injection).

## 2. Prompt Injection & AI Hacking Prevention
- Treat AI prompts as a boundary: sanitize, escape, and control insertion points.
- Use strict grammar and format tokens to isolate user input.
- Implement prompt schema validation to avoid rogue behavior.
- Log and audit all prompt modifications or overrides.
- Stay vigilant: prompt injection is a real and emerging threat—even considered potentially "unsolvable" by experts.

## 3. Secure Model Access & Rate Limiting
- Authenticate and authorize every AI model request.
- Enforce strict rate limits to prevent abuse (e.g., repeated cracking attempts).
- Use tenant isolation to segregate user sessions and data.

## 4. API Security & Communication
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all model/API traffic.
- Validate certificates and rotate API keys regularly.
- Monitor access patterns for anomalies (sudden spikes, strange endpoints).

## 5. Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response
- Log incoming data, AI responses, errors, throughput, latency.
- Set up real-time alerts for suspicious patterns (e.g., rapid-fire similar prompts).
- Regularly test incident readiness (e.g., simulate attacks).

## 6. Defense Against DDoS & Resource Abuse
- Implement rate limiting and quotas per IP, user, or session.
- Leverage CDN and WAF protections to absorb or filter traffic spikes.
- Use autoscaling and circuit breakers to isolate problematic behavior.

## 7. Data Security & Privacy
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Mask personally identifiable information in logs.
- Avoid exposing training data or proprietary model internals.
- Implement data retention and deletion policies (e.g., GDPR compliant).

## 8. Secure Deployment & Environment Hygiene
- Use least privilege for services accessing models or data.
- Automate infrastructure updates and patching (OS, containers, dependencies).
- Employ secrets management for API keys, certificates, etc.

## 9. Model Hardening & Adversarial Resilience
- Use request validation to strip or neutralize adversarial tokens.
- Reject or sanitize unexpected control sequences (e.g., special tokens, system commands).
- Periodically test the model with adversarial examples or red-team prompting.

## 10. User Awareness & Secure Defaults
- Assume user input may be malicious—design defenses accordingly.
- Use safe defaults: block unknown or ambiguous requests.
- Offer transparency and user guidance (e.g., “Why was my input modified?”).

###  Additional Threat Models to Consider

| Threat Type | Description | Mitigation |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Prompt Injection** | Malicious or crafted prompts that manipulate AI behavior | Prompt sanitization, token isolation, schema enforcement |
| **Adversarial Examples** | Inputs specifically shaped to mislead models | Input validation, anomaly detection, adversarial testing |
| **DDoS / Resource Exhaustion** | Overloading model endpoints with high-volume requests | Rate limiting, autoscaling, WAF/CDN protection |
| **Model Theft / API Misuse** | Unauthorized model usage or reverse engineering | API authentication, usage limits, watermarking responses |
| **Data Leakage** | Inadvertent exposure of training or private data | Data sanitization, prompt filtering, careful logging |
| **Supply-chain / Dependency Risks** | Compromised libraries or containers | Verified dependencies, signed builds, periodic audits |
